# Hello, 

My name is **Tiago**, and this is my lair. 

As an **Information Systems** student —  trying to find balance outside the daily grind — I dedicate my time to **Web programming** and **Linguistics**, as well as the **essays** I write.

Apart from that, there is nothing groundbreaking enough for the homepage, but just interesting enough to, every now and then, pop up in the body of a [*post*](https://tiagojx.github.io/blog/posts).
